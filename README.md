# Flappy-Bird-Q-learning-Rev.2
Q learning with rng pipes turned on. Currently a WIP. May not be stable until complete. 

Game code by: https://github.com/TimoWilken/flappy-bird-pygame
Q learning code by me

# Why two versions?
First revision has rng pipes turned off and some disgusting work arounds with rewards. This has rng pipes tunred on and should be cleaner code wise. In theory after some learning it should be able to complete many pipes after dealing with the first two sets heavily.
